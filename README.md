# r-nagios-scripts
Random Nagios scripts, like plugins or check_commands
Most of these are designed to run from the Nagios host and SSH into other machines to run checks.
This allows for centralization of configuration and management, without needing additional servers running on all machines.

These checks are mostly written to be executed on Ubuntu and SSH into Ubuntu, unless otherwise stated.
