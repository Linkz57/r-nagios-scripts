## custom_check_for_fs_inotify_max_user_instances_via_ssh.sh
## version 1.0
## $1 is ssh username
## $2 is ssh address
## $3 is path to check (syslog is expected)
## $4 is age in seconds that's considered too recent. EG: 172800 is 3 days.
##
##
## To use this yourself, (on Ubuntu 18.04 with Nagios Core 4.4.5)
## save custom_check_for_fs_inotify_max_user_instances_via_ssh.sh to /usr/local/nagios/libexec
## chmod +x custom_check_for_fs_inotify_max_user_instances_via_ssh.sh
## add following four lines to /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg
## define command {
##        command_name    custom_check_for_fs_inotify_max_user_instances_via_ssh
##        command_line    $USER1$/custom_check_for_fs_inotify_max_user_instances_via_ssh.sh $ARG1$ $ARG2$ $ARG3$ $ARG4$    ## ARG1 is ssh username, ARG2 is storage server address, ARG3 is path to syslog, ARG4 is age in seconds that's considered too recent.
##}
##
##
## then add the following seven lines to your host definition files, like /usr/local/nagios/etc/servers/mahserver.cfg
## define service {
##        use                             generic-service
##        host_name                       mahserver
##        service_description             Make sure no soft kernel limits have been hit recently
##        check_command                   custom_check_for_fs_inotify_max_user_instances_via_ssh!user!127.000.000.001!/var/log/syslog!172800
##;          arguments are seperated by "!"           command                                ssh_user   ssh_address   path_to_syslog       unacceptable age in seconds
##}

##
## That's all it takes to start using a new Nagios script.
##
## This script, however, requires automatic, password-less ssh access to your rsyslog server,
## or to every one of your individual machines
## Use this guide to give your Nagios user that power:
## http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/11/3-steps-to-perform-ssh-login-without-password-using-ssh-keygen-ssh-copy-id/
## It's only 2 steps. Remember to run these two steps AS THE USER that runs the Nagios check scripts.
## Running "sudo su nagios" might do it.
##
## then run "sudo systemctl restart nagios" and you're done. Or you've spelled something wrong,
## running journalctl -xeu nagios might show you where the error is.
