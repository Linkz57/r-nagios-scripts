## version 1.1
## $1 is ssh username
## $2 is ssh address
##
## There are a lot of good reasons for Proxmox to lock an LXC container,
## performing backups, migrations, etc. When one of those fails in an ambiguous way,
## the container will remain locked forever without human intervention.
## If the container is locked while running, it'll stay running oblivious to its "locked" label.
## If you want to then perform a rolling update, for example, you can't migrate the locked containers.
## This script will watch a single Proxmox box.
## Tested with PVE version 5.4-13 and 6.0-9
